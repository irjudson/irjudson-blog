## Pro Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Be specific** - The more context you give Claude, the better the output
2. **Iterate** - Don't hesitate to ask for revisions ("make this more technical", "shorter", etc.)
3. **Provide examples** - Link to previous posts you like as style references
4. **Raw is fine** - Your input can be messy notes; Claude will structure it
5. **Trust the process** - Let Claude handle the mechanical work while you focus on ideas

---

## Custom Prompt Template

If none of the above fit, use this general structure:

```
Topic: [what you're writing about]

Content/Ideas: [your raw thoughts, notes, outline]

Audience: [who should read this]
Length: [target word count]
Tone: [technical/casual/professional/etc.]
LinkedIn: [YES/NO/MAYBE]

Special requirements: [anything specific to this post]

Please create:
1. [what you need from Claude]
2. [any specific requests]

Additional context: [anything else helpful]
```

Remember: These are starting points. Customize based on your specific post needs. The goal is to give Claude enough context to create a complete, polished package while maintaining your voice and intent.
