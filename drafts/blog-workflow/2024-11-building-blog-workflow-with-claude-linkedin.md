# LinkedIn Version - Building a Blog Workflow with Claude Code

**Post this to LinkedIn when publishing the blog post**

---

## Title/Hook:
I just reduced my blog publishing workflow from 2-3 hours to 10-30 minutes using Claude Code. Here's how.

## Body:

Blogging friction isn't about writing—it's about everything *except* writing.

The overhead that kills momentum:
→ Formatting and structure
→ SEO optimization (titles, descriptions, slugs)
→ Image management and copyright notices
→ WordPress metadata wrestling
→ Version control and backups

So I built a workflow that automates all of it.

**The result:** Idea to published post in 10-30 minutes.

**How it works:**

1. Give Claude my raw ideas (brain dump, bullets, whatever)
2. Claude creates complete package (post, SEO, LinkedIn version, checklist)
3. I publish to WordPress (copy-paste, add photos, done)
4. Archive in GitHub (version control, backup)

**What makes this different:**

I'm not outsourcing writing to AI. I'm outsourcing *formatting* to AI.

I still:
- Decide what to write about
- Provide the ideas and expertise
- Review and approve everything
- Add my photos and personal touches

Claude handles:
- Markdown formatting
- SEO optimization
- Structure and flow
- Publishing checklists
- Copyright notices

**The setup includes:**
- 10+ Claude prompt templates for different post types
- Complete WordPress publishing workflow
- Copyright protection for content and photos
- Migration script for legacy posts (moved 28 posts in 10 minutes)
- All MIT licensed (except content, which stays copyrighted)

**The bonus:** As I built this, I also created [github-profile-upgrade](https://github.com/irjudson/github-profile-upgrade)—same philosophy, different domain. Solve your own problem thoroughly, make it reusable, share it.

This is how AI tools should work: removing mechanical friction, not removing judgment or agency.

Small optimizations at friction points create disproportionate returns.

The friction is gone. The writing remains mine.
