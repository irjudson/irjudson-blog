<p><strong>"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."</strong> - Seneca</p>

<p>I call it serendipity. You can't control when the right opportunity appears. But you can control whether you're prepared when it does.</p>

<h2>The Preparation Gap</h2>

<p>Most engineers prepare for opportunity by building skills, shipping code, solving problems. Crucial. But incomplete.</p>

<p><strong>What they're missing:</strong> Being findable when opportunity looks for them.</p>

<p><strong>The pattern I see constantly:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Engineer has 5+ years of strong distributed systems experience</li>
<li>GitHub profile: empty bio, disconnected from LinkedIn, no context</li>
<li>Recruiter searches for those exact skills</li>
<li>Can't find them or assess fit quickly</li>
<li>Opportunity goes elsewhere</li>
</ul>
Not a skills problem. A visibility problem.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What Prepared Looks Like</h2>

<p>After hiring dozens of engineers and recently transitioning from Microsoft to Harper, I know what recruiters look for in their 10-second scan:</p>

<p><strong>1. Connected presence:</strong> GitHub ↔ LinkedIn. Recruiters validate technical ability on GitHub, contact via LinkedIn. If disconnected, they move on.</p>

<p><strong>2. Clear value:</strong> Your bio communicates what you do, what scale, what you're looking for. Pattern-matching in 3 seconds, not 3 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>3. Current activity:</strong> Contributions in last 3-6 months. Shows you're ready now, not rusty.</p>

<p>That's it. Everything else is decoration.</p>

<h2>The Toolkit</h2>

<p>I built <a href="https://github.com/irjudson/github-profile-upgrade">github-profile-upgrade</a> to systematize this preparation.</p>

<strong>Includes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Templates for different career stages</li>
<li>Claude Code integration (5-minute setup vs. 2-3 hours manual)</li>
<li>Data-driven priority checklist</li>
<li>150+ auto-updating technology badges</li>
<li>GitHub Actions for maintenance</li>
</ul>
<strong>Setup:</strong>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/irjudson/github-profile-upgrade
# Tell Claude: "Help me set up my GitHub profile using these templates"
# Review, customize, push</code></pre>

<p><strong>Time:</strong> 5 minutes. Then automated.</p>

<p><strong>License:</strong> MIT. Free. Use it.</p>

<h2>Real Impact</h2>

<p><strong>Entry-level engineer:</strong> "Set up profile. Two weeks later, first recruiter contact. I was prepared when they looked."</p>

<p><strong>Mid-career developer:</strong> "Profile views went from 20/month to 80/month. Got contacted for perfect role."</p>

<p><strong>Senior engineer:</strong> "Wasn't searching. Got approached for architect role I'd never have found. When opportunity came, I was prepared."</p>

<p>Pattern: They prepared their visibility. When opportunity looked, they were ready.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Not Gaming the System</h2>

<p><strong>This isn't:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Faking skills you don't have</li>
<li>Over-promising abilities</li>
<li>Gaming recruiter searches</li>
</ul>
<strong>This is:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Clearly communicating skills you actually have</li>
<li>Making real experience visible</li>
<li>Being findable when opportunity searches for what you do</li>
</ul>
The metaphor: You can't control when it rains, but you can fix your roof before the storm.</p>

<hr />

<h2>When to Prepare</h2>

<p><strong>Best time:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Right now (whether employed or not)</li>
<li>After completing a project</li>
<li>When learning new tech</li>
<li>When you have breathing room</li>
</ul>
<strong>Worst time:</strong>
<ul>
<li>During active job search (should already be done)</li>
<li>Right after layoff</li>
<li>When stressed</li>
</ul>
<strong>The principle:</strong> Prepare during peace, benefit during war.</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Compound Effect</h2>

<strong>If you prepare today:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Week 3-4: First unexpected contact</li>
<li>Month 2-3: Network effects kick in</li>
<li>Month 6+: Opportunities you didn't seek</li>
</ul>
<strong>If you don't:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Perfect opportunity appears</li>
<li>Recruiter searches your exact skills</li>
<li>Doesn't find you</li>
<li>You never know it existed</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h2>Beyond Job Search</h2>

<p>I'm not searching. I'm at Harper and excited about what we're building.</p>

<p>My profile is still optimized because opportunity doesn't only come when you're looking:
<ul>
<li>Consulting inquiries</li>
<li>Speaking invitations</li>
<li>Open source collaborations</li>
<li>Future roles I haven't imagined</li>
</ul>
Preparation isn't just for job searches. It's for staying open to serendipity.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Career Serendipity</h2>

<p>What I've learned over 30+ years: careers are shaped less by grand plans, more by prepared serendipity.</p>

<p><strong>The moments that mattered:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Got approached for role that changed trajectory</li>
<li>Someone found my work, led to collaboration</li>
<li>Right person saw profile at right time</li>
</ul>
Could I have planned these? No. Could I have been prepared? Absolutely.</p>
