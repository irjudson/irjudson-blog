You can't control when the right opportunity appears. But you can control whether you're prepared when it does.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝗜 𝘀𝗲𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆:

Engineer with 5+ years strong experience.
GitHub: empty bio, disconnected from LinkedIn.

Recruiter searches for those exact skills.
Can't find them or assess fit quickly.
Opportunity goes elsewhere.

Not a skills problem. A visibility problem.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 "𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗱" 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲:

1. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 - GitHub ↔ LinkedIn integration. Recruiters validate on GitHub, contact via LinkedIn.

2. 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲 - Bio communicates what you do, what scale, what you're looking for. Pattern-match in 3 seconds.

3. 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆 - Contributions in last 3-6 months. Shows you're ready now.

That's it. Everything else is decoration.

→ Claude Code integration (5 min setup)

→ Data-driven checklist

𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁:

Entry-level: "Set up profile. Two weeks later, first recruiter contact."

Mid-career: "Profile views 20/month → 80/month. Got perfect role."

Senior: "Wasn't searching. Got approached for architect role I'd never have found."

Pattern: They prepared. When opportunity looked, they were ready.

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲:

Best: Right now (whether employed or not)
Worst: During active job search (should already be done)

The principle: Prepare during peace, benefit during war.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁:

Prepare today*:
- Week 3-4: First unexpected contact

- Month 2-3: Network effects kick in
- Month 6+: Opportunities you didn't seek

*Your mileage may vary!

Don't prepare:
- Perfect opportunity appears

- They search your exact skills
- Don't find you
- You never know it existed

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗺𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 𝗜'𝗺 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴:

Opportunity doesn't only come when you're looking.

I'm at Harper, excited about what we're building. But opportunities still come:
- Consulting inquiries

- Speaking invitations
- Future roles I haven't imagined

Careers are shaped less by grand plans, more by prepared serendipity.
