Back in May I accepted a position on the Strategic Engagements team at Microsoft. It's a great group of people, with cool opportunities. We are still figuring out the lay of the land, but we're much closer to understanding what we do and how we do it than we were three months ago. It doesn't help that we have doubled or tripled in size (and we're still growing, contact me if you're interested).

The team is made up of the following folks, who also have cool blogs (this is my way of cross-linking for now):

- [Tim Park](http://timpark.io)

- [Stefan Gordon](http://stefangordon.com)

- [Yaron Golund](http://goland.org)

- [Jim Spring](https://twitter.com/jmspring)

- [Mike Lanzetta](http://www.mikelanzetta.com/)
