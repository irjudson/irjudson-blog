The calendar year starts in January - it's an artificial reset. Resets are extremely useful for humans to draw a line between past performance and future hope. It's no accident we make resolutions about our future hopes during these times.

I don't make resolutions, I make plans. My plans are already unfolding. My plan is to be the best human I can be, so that I can be the best at loving those around me.

Sounds like a simple plan, but it requires balancing so many competing things - like work and life, passion and responsibility, self and other - nothing is simple.

I look forward to sharing more this year as I pursue this plan, I'll start with some catch up posts focusing on my smithing, sailing, and gardening!
