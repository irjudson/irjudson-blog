Over the course of time I've worked for **and** with a great many enterprises. Some public, some private, some "key players", some "boutique" -- almost every one of those collaborations was driven by a purpose: A project to complete, software to write, a device to build -- stories to be told.

A decade ago, I attended WWDC. I helped found (the now defunct) maclearning and macresearch communities to round out the (then thriving) macenterprise community. All before the epic changes we've seen in Apple.

I was in the keynote when Steve announced Mac OS X. I was there for Universal binaries (we actually registered phatbinary.org just for fun - during the keynote).

Nothing prepared me for my first [//build](http://www.buildwindows.com/).

I work for [John Shewchuk](http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/john-shewchuk-technical-fellow-at-microsoft-speaks-on-stage-news-photo/471657222) in a team named Strategic Engagements. What you saw in the keynotes of this conference were but a glimpse of the awesome I get to experience every day. I'm only 11 months at Microsoft, but let me share some highpoints of my time already:

- Joined a newly forming team as member #5ish - nobody actually knows anymore.

- Paris for a week learning about AllJoyn, later, we announce Windows 10 support for [AllJoyn](https://allseenalliance.org/).

- Lots of hackathons helping startups and companies solve problems. A few interesting ones (go check them out!):
A. [Heatworks Model1](http://www.myheatworks.com/)
B. [WallFlower](http://www.wallflower.com/)
C. [Chai Energy](https://chaienergy.com/)
D. [Scanalytics](http://www.scanalyticsinc.com/)
E. [Sensorberg](https://www.sensorberg.com/)
F. Unnamed companies doing awesomenes.

- Going on the talk circuit, giving talks on AllJoyn, Hadoop, The Internet of Things, Innovation, and Microsoft.

- Attending //Build 2015.

At this point, I'm going to hide in a tech cave and work on a set of cool projects that we can use to launch next years assault on your notion of what Microsoft is.

This is not your dad's Microsoft. We have a leader. With a Vision.

We have the [band](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us). We have [windows10](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/about). We have [HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us).

More importantly, we have a **deep bench**. Keep your eyes open. It's going to be a wild ride!
