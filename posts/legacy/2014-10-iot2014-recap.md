This week I've been in Cambridge, MA to talk about Microsoft's IoT solutions: Intelligent Systems Services, Project Reykjavik, and [Nitrogen](http://nitrogen.io). It was an excellent conference, wrapping up Wednesday with a demo event where everyone had a chance to show off their interesting projects and tools.

Thursday I spent at the Microsoft offices right around the corner from the IoT conference with a startup named [WallFlower](http://www.wallflower.com/). WallFlower is a part of the Microsoft Ventures Startup Accelerator in Redmond, but they're headquartered in Cambridge.

Through a series of meetings and discussions I was able to introduce them to an old collaborator of mine Kurt Keville and a company I had not known about until this week: [DogHunter, LLC](http://doghunter.org/), manufacturers of beautifully designed embedded/embedable hardware that runs their OpenWRT based distribution referred to as [Linino](http://www.linino.org/).

Whether WallFlower and DogHunter find any common implementation projects, it's pretty clear to me they are both going to do some very interesting things in the very near future. I look forward to visting them again soon.
