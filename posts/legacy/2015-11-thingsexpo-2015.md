Yesterday I had the pleasure of talking at [ThingsExpo](http://www.thingsexpo.com/). I was asked by the great folks at [The Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org) and their [AllJoyn Framework](https://allseenalliance.org/framework).

Here's a link to my talk, [Building IoT Devices with AllJoyn](https://cdn.rawgit.com/irjudson/AJIntro/ThingsExpo/index.html).

The talk happened as the last talk of the day in the technical track, I downed a much needed double espresso at 5:20 and started talking at 5:40. At 6:20 I paused to breath. The time was spent with almost 50 very engaged folks with awesome questions, tons of suggestions, and lots of ideas.

I look forward to a ton of discussions in the next few weeks while I followup with the attendees.

Thanks to the Linux Foundation and AllJoyn project for asking me to help out!
